OIL RESERVE ESTIMATION USING MONTE CARLO SIMULATION

THIS CODE WAS WRITTEN TO ENABLE OPEN SOURCE ESTIMATION OF OIL RESERVES
TO GIVE THE DECESION MAKERS A ROUGH ESTIMATE FOR THE INITIAL FIELD DEVELOPMENT 
PLANS. THE APPLICATION COULD BE USED AS A TOOL WHILE WORKING ON BIGGER RESERVOIR 
SIMULATION APPLICATIONS WHERE RESERVE ESTIMATION PLAYS A MAJOR ROLE.
