OIL RESERVE ESTIMATION USING MONTE CARLO SIMUALTION

THIS CODE WAS WRITTEN TO ENABLE OPEN SOURCE ESTIMATION OF OIL RESERVES
TO GIVE THE DECESION MAKERS A ROUGH ESTIMATE FOR THE INTIAL FIELD DEVELOPMENT 
PLANS. THE APLLICATION COULD BE USED AS A TOOL WHILE WORKING ON BIGGER RESERVOIR 
SIMUALTION APPLICATIONS WHERE RESERVE ESTIMATION PLAYS A MAJOR ROLE.
